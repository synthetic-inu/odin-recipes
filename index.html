<h2>Cheap and Easy Meals for College Students</h2>

<div class="home-intro">
<p>Going to college means more independence, but part of that independence means learning to cook for yourself. While the dining hall is a nice option, it won't last forever â€” and let's be honest, sometimes you can get tired of the same food. But college is a busy time, and we know the last thing you want to do is make a full-blown meal after a long day of studying. So this collection of recipes contains main dish options that are quick and easy to make for beginners, and some of them can even be made in your dorm room. Plus, these recipes won't break the bank and only require a few simple, cheap ingredients. No more telling your parents you're living on instant ramen. </p>
