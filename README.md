Project: Recipes

The purpose of this project is to practice the HTML knowledge acquired through the "Foundations Course" from "The Odin Project".

This project has to consist on a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The pages should also have listings and images. Initially, the website won't look pretty but it will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.

I started by creating only the bare minimum to have a functional website. This means that there's a Home Page and 3 Recipe Pages that interconnect with each other. However, there is no real content on them (text, images, etc). I did this so I could test the Version Control Systems as those have been my main struggle so far. 

This is my second attempt as I got stuck with the commit process and I decided to start all over. After a couple more attempts I finally found the problem which was that I did not pushed the commits into GitHub. I was able to found the root of the problem and the solution on the terminal. I must remember to use "git push" so the project can be updated on GitHub.
